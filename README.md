## What Makes Southsea Pearls So Special?
Southsea pearls are considered one of the most precious types of pearls in the world. They are cultivated in the warm waters of the South Pacific and are famous for their natural golden and white shades. Unlike ordinary pearls, these pearls are much larger, ranging from 9mm to 20mm in size, making them rare and highly valuable.
